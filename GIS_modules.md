## Installing various GIS modules and their subsequent use
Much of this documentation is built on the documentation made avaliable by [aleaf](https://github.com/aleaf). Thanks for sharing it  Andy!

First before installing any of the GIS packages below i recommend installing [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/). Anaconda can be installed for both python 2.7 and 3.6 (currently). It holds most of the python modules needed for scientfic computing.

Here it will be documented how various packages for managing, reading and writing GIS data can be downloaded and installed. Doing this directly for each module can be rather difficult because of external dependencies. But thanks to Christoph Gohlke's Unofficial Windows Binaries site (http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/) this has become much easier. Christoph has packed the python modules together with their library dependencies into binary ("wheel") files that can be installed using Python's pip package management system. This will be further detailed below.

First we describe the various modules, thir functionality and links to the documentation.

|  Module  |  Purpose  |  Dependencies  |  Unofficial binary  |  Documentation  |
|----------|-----------|----------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| *fiona*  | reads and writes shapefiles |
| *shapely*| provides containers and operations for manipulating vector data (points, lines and polygons)|
| *gdal*   | 
| *rasterio* |
| *rtree* |
| *pyproj* |
| *rasterstats* |
| *geopandas* |
