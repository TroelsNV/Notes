## Installing various GIS modules and their use
Much of this documentation has been obtained from [aleaf](https://github.com/aleaf). Thanks for making it avaliable Andy!

First before installing any of the GIS packages below i recommend installing [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/). Anaconda can be installed for both python 2.7 and 3.6 (currently). It holds most of the python modules needed for scientfic computing.
